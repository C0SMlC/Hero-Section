# Hero-Section
The Hero section on a website is the large, typically full-screen area that a user sees when first arriving at your web page.
The Hero section:

-> Grabs the user’s attention and convinces them to look around
-> Reassures the user that they have come to the correct place
-> Explains how the user’s problem can be solved
-> Provides a clear call to action
